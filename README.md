## Quickstart

The easiest way to use the package is as a
[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) tool. You can simply start
searching for properties using the following command:

```bash
uvx bolig-ping --city københavn
```

This both installs the package and runs the command. All the available options are
listed below, but you can always get these by running the following command:

```bash
uvx bolig-ping --help
```


To be able to send emails, you have to create a [Google app
password](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords), and store both your Gmail email
address and the app password in the environment variables `GMAIL_EMAIL` and
`GMAIL_PASSWORD`, respectively. You can also simply store these in a `.env` file, as
follows:

```bash
GMAIL_EMAIL=<your-email>@gmail.com
GMAIL_PASSWORD=<your-app-password>
```

With this set up, you can now use the `--email` option to receive an email with new
properties that match your search criteria:

```bash
uvx bolig-ping --city københavn --email <your-email>
```

You can also set up a recurring search if you have a server available. In this case, you
can add the following line to your [crontab](https://linuxhandbook.com/crontab/) on a
server, to run the search every hour:

```bash
0 * * * * <uvx-full-path> bolig-ping <search-arguments>
```

Here `<uvx-full-path>` is the full path to the `uvx` command, which you can find by
running `which uvx` in your terminal.


## All options

The following options are available:

- `--city/-c` (required): The city you want to search in. This argument can be
  used several times to search in multiple cities, e.g., `-c aarhus -c odense`.
- `--min-price`: The minimum price of the property, in DKK. Default is no minimum price.
- `--max-price`: The maximum price of the property, in DKK. Default is no maximum price.
- `--min-monthly-fee`: The minimum monthly fee of the property, in DKK. Default is no
  minimum monthly fee.
- `--max-monthly-fee`: The maximum monthly fee of the property, in DKK. Default is no
  maximum monthly fee.
- `--min-rooms`: The minimum number of rooms in the property. Default is no minimum
  number of rooms.
- `--max-rooms`: The maximum number of rooms in the property. Default is no maximum
  number of rooms.
- `--min-size`: The minimum size of the property, in square meters. Default is no
  minimum size.
- `--max-size`: The maximum size of the property, in square meters. Default is no
  maximum size.
- `--query/-q`: The query to search for in the property description. This argument can
  be used several times to search for multiple queries, e.g., `-q badekar -q altan`.
- `--property-type/-t`: The type of property to search for. The available property
  types are `ejerlejlighed`, `andelslejlighed` and `house`. This argument can be used
  several times to search for multiple property types, e.g., `-t ejerlejlighed -t house`.
  Default is only searching for `ejerlejlighed`.
- `--email`: The email address you want to receive the ping on. Note that this needs to
  have the `GMAIL_EMAIL` and `GMAIL_PASSWORD` environment variables set, as described
  above. Default is to use no email address, and instead print the properties to the
  console.
- `--cache/--no-cache`: Whether to use the cache or not. Default is to use the cache,
  but you can disable it by using the `--no-cache` flag. This is useful if you want to
  see all the results, and not just the new ones. The cache is stored in the
  `.boligping_cache` file in the current directory.
